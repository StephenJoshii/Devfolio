# Devfolio
DevFolio - A Simple Project Portfolio Platform
DevFolio is a full-stack web application built from the ground up to solve a common problem for developers: how to easily create and share a clean, professional portfolio of their work. Instead of just a list of links, DevFolio provides a simple dashboard for managing projects and generates a public, shareable portfolio page for each user.

This project was built to demonstrate a practical, real-world application using a modern .NET backend and a lightweight vanilla JavaScript frontend.

Features
Multi-User Accounts: Secure user registration and login system powered by ASP.NET Core Identity.

Project Management: A private admin dashboard where logged-in users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) their own projects.

Dynamic Public Portfolios: Automatically generates a clean, public portfolio page for each user (e.g., /?user=USER_ID).

Modern API: A backend built with .NET 8 Minimal APIs, following RESTful principles.

Persistent Storage: Uses a local SQLite database to save all user and project data.

Tech Stack
Backend: C#, .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs

Database: SQLite with Entity Framework Core 8

Authentication: ASP.NET Core Identity

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

API Testing: Swagger / OpenAPI

Getting Started: How to Run Locally

dotnet ef database update

Run the application:

dotnet run

You're all set! The application will now be running on a local port (e.g., http://localhost:5298).

How to Use the Application
